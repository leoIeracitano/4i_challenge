# 4i_challenge

This repository consists of the resolution of cases sent by the company. Case 1 was solved with R language and case 2 was solved in Python. For those who wish to run the programs on the machine, it is important to pay attention to changing the directory, always at the beginning of the algorithms. In case 2, we use a reading from a color gradient to sort some tables. For some reason this gradient is not being seen on GitHub, but it is perfectly possible to see it if it is run in a jupyter environment (or any preferred interpreter).

Thank you very much and great reading!
